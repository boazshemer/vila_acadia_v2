# Code Cleanup Summary - February 4, 2026

## 🧹 Minimal Cleanup for Production Deployment

### Files Removed (Safe Deletions)

#### 1. ✅ `service-account.json` - **CRITICAL SECURITY FIX**
- **Reason:** Contains sensitive Google Cloud credentials (private keys)
- **Risk:** Exposed credentials could allow unauthorized access to Google Sheets
- **Status:** Removed from repository + confirmed in `.gitignore`
- **Impact:** ✅ None - credentials loaded from environment variable `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`

#### 2. ✅ `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Outdated Documentation
- **Reason:** Historical documentation from previous cleanup (Jan 29, 2026)
- **Risk:** Confusing outdated information
- **Status:** Removed
- **Impact:** ✅ None - replaced by this file

#### 3. ✅ `test_quick.bat` - Development Script
- **Reason:** Windows-specific test runner batch file
- **Risk:** None, but not needed in production
- **Status:** Removed
- **Impact:** ✅ None - can use `pytest` directly

## 📋 Files Kept (Potentially Removable But Safe to Keep)

### Development Tools (Kept for developer convenience)
- ✅ `verify.py` - Setup verification (useful for new developers)
- ✅ `run_tests.py` - Interactive test runner (useful for testing)
- ✅ `src/backend/run.py` - Alternative server entry point (harmless)

### Docker Files (Kept for flexibility)
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - May be used in future
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` - May be used in future
- ✅ `.dockerignore` - Supports Docker if needed

**Reason for keeping:** These files don't impact production deployment to Railway and provide flexibility for future deployment options.

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Confirmed in `.gitignore`:
```
✅ .env
✅ service-account.json
✅ __pycache__/
✅ venv/
✅ node_modules/
✅ *.log
```

### Environment Variables Required in Railway:
```env
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=<your_sheet_id>
SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=<paste_json_content>
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.com
MANAGER_PASSWORD=<secure_password>
```
